# Taskset Agent Instructions

Apply the repository skill `$standards` to all planning, implementation, review,
testing, documentation, release, and architecture work.

The skill is located at:

```text
skills/standards/SKILL.md
```

Read `SKILL.md` first. Load its task-relevant reference routing maps, then only
the topic files needed for the current task:

- `references/architecture.md` to route product invariants, storage, package
  ownership, client FBA, modular core/server architecture, snapshots, and docs
- `references/conventions.md` to route naming, TypeScript, entity files, tests,
  and documentation style
- `references/workflows.md` to route pnpm, Turbo, Vitest, TDD, and validation
- `references/release.md` for compatibility, Changesets, and completion

Treat `agents/openai.yaml` as Codex UI and invocation metadata, not repository
instructions.

Update the skill and relevant references whenever repository architecture,
commands, package names, persisted formats, documentation workflows, or
completion rules change.
